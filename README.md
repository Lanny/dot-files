# dot-files
Personal config files other than vim. Nothing to see here. If you're me and you were looking for the vimrc repo then you want to look [here](https://github.com/RyanJenkins/dot-vim).

# ZSH
The `~/.zshrc-local` file will be sourced as part of .zshrc, if you're fucking with PATH you probably want to do it there.
